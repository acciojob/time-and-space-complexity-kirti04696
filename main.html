	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept used to measure 
		how the runtime of an algorithm changes with 
		the size of the input. It helps in analyzing which 
		algorithm is more efficient when solving a particular
		problem.
   </p>
	<p><b>Space complexity </b>refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. 
		It's a measure of how much storage space is required for the 
		algorithm to execute and solve a problem. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input. </p>
